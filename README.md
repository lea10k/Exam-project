## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lea10k/Exam-project.git
    ```
2. Open the project in [Unity Editor](https://unity.com/).
3. Select the MainMenu scene at Assets/Scenes.
4. Press the **Play** button in the Unity Editor to start the game.

## How to Execute the Built File on MacOS that was created on Windows

> **Note:** The built file for Mac cannot be compressed as a ZIP file. If you do, the game will no longer be executable. Therefor, a TAR file is the best solution. 

1. Decompress the TAR file.
2. Open a terminal and enter:
    ```bash
    cd built.app/Contents/MacOS
    ```
    You may need to adjust the command to navigate to the “MacOS” directory, depending on where you saved the TAR file.
3. Enter:
    ```bash
    chmod -R 755 game
    ```
4. Now you can double-click on the built application and the game should run. Force execute the file if your anti-virus program blocks the execution.

## How to Play
- **Move Left:** Press the **Left Arrow** key
- **Move Right:** Press the **Right Arrow** key
- **Jump:** Press the **Space Bar**
  > **Note:** The space bar should be pressed harder and longer to reach other objects properly. 
- **Use Weapon:** Press the **E** key
- **Reload Level:** Press **R**. A short on-screen hint reminds you of this during play.
